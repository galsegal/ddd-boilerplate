#DDD Boilerplate - A Project Template For Visual Studio
Creating a DDD solution involves creating many projects for to support DDD structure. This is a tedious job that repeats itself on every new project you create. I noticed most, if not all, projects could use this structure naturally and wanted to speed things up...

I have created a DDD project template for VS2012 that makes all the work.
It includes all the projects and test project needed. There is no code - just the projects and their names. It is just the bare bones needed to get started - no code, no dependencies, just empty projects.

##How To Use It?
+ The template file called "DDD.zip"
+ Copy the file to C:\Users\{your name}\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C# 
+ Open VS and select "New Project"
+ Under "Visual C# Projects" find "DDD Project Template"
+ Give the solution a name you want and click "OK"
+ You're on!

##Improtant Note
Make sure you put this project in a folder with a short path like "C:\Projects". 

Since the  namespacing is long, Windows find it hard to create a file with a long path, So don't use it for projects that sits under
"C:\Users\gals\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Projects\".

Enjoy it and feel free to contribute.
Go DDD!
